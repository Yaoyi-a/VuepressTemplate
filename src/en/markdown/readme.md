# Markdown Introduction

Markdown is a markup language that can be written using a plain text editor that allows plain text content to be formatted with simple markup syntax.

Markdown has a series of derivative versions that extend Markdown's functionality (such as tables, footnotes, embedded HTML, etc.). These features were not available in the original Markdown. They can convert Markdown into more formats, such as LaTeX, Docbook. . Markdown Extra, MultiMarkdown, Maruku, etc. are more famous in Markdown's enhanced version. These derivative versions are either based on tools such as Pandoc; or based on websites such as GitHub and Wikipedia, which are basically syntactically compatible, but have some changes in syntax and rendering effects.

## Usage

Markdown's grammar is simple and straightforward, easy to learn, and features more powerful than plain text, so many people use it to write blogs. WordPress, the world's most popular blogging platform, and large CMSs such as Joomla and Drupal all support Markdown. The blog platforms that use the Markdown editor are Ghost and Typecho.

Used to write documentation and save it under the software's directory under the file name "README.md".
In addition, because we have a god-level editor like RStudio, we can quickly turn Markdown into a presentation PPT, Word product documentation, LaTex papers, and even a minimally usable prototype with very little code. In the field of data science, Markdown has been widely used, greatly promoting the historical process of dynamic repeatability research.
